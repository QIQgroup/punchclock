I've already done a good hunk of work without tracking it (or not tracking it properly.
Keep track of all Modules for All Projects dynamically via Drush Commands (best via JSON)
Maybe Fields for each of these reports that can hold the most recent JSON
Maybe logic that writes the file to a Stamped copy of the JSON
And then Dynamically Write that to a Gold filename (see below) maybe in its own Directory for dynamic feeding.
drupal Key (same as MD5 UNO Password - etc)
data Key (should be a table)
NOT 'report' since that is what comes from the 'data'
dataKey__drupalKey_YYYYMMDDHHIISS.json
dataKey_drupalKey.json (GOLD)
